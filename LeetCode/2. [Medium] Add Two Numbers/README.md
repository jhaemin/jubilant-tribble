You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order** and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Example:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
<b>Output:</b> 7 -> 0 -> 8
<b>Explanation:</b> 342 + 465 = 807.
</pre>
